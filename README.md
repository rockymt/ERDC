# ERDC
Elastic Rod based on Discrete Curvature

The essential codes(Matlab/Octave) for examples in "A geometrically exact discrete elastic rod model based on improved discrete curvature". Some programs uses the function "assem.m" in Calfem from Lund Institute of Technology. Download it from website: https://github.com/CALFEM/calfem-matlab/tree/master/fem.

Unzip "ERDC.zip" and run "main*.m" in each subfolder.
